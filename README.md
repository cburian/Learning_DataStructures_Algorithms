# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

In this project I will practice:

1. Python data structures:  

    1.1 built-in:

       1.1.1 String  
       1.1.2 List

    1.2 non-built-in:

        1.2.0 Arrays
        1.2.1 Stack, Queue, Deque
        1.2.2 Linked-Lists: Singly, Doubly, Circular
   
2. Algorithms:  

    2.1 Recursion  
    2.2 Searching
