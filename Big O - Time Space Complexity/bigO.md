## Time ( and Space ) is Money

__How long will our code take to run, how much space will the solution use__

## Complexity

Time and space complexity helps us compare and generalize.

> "Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary 
operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary 
operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform." - Wikipedia

## Behavior, Relationships, and Operations

##### Right side of our complexity equation:

Time and Space Complexity at this level describe the relationship between 
Inputs and rate of operations/space taken. You still need to find the specific 
inputs, operations and space units.

## Behavior and O Notation ( aka Big O Notation )

O notation is a mathematical convention that is used to describe these 
relationships.

> "Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting 
behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or 
infinity." - Wiki

## Common O Notations or Complexity Types:

### Most common complexities:

#### 1. CONSTANT complexity:
O(1) - it takes at most the same amount of time or space for one or many

#### 2. LOGARITHMIC complexity:
O(log n) - increases at first but then it stabilizes and changes less

![logatithmic time](../Images/bigO_05.png)

#### 3. LINEAR complexity:
O(n) - increases at worst at a fixed/liner rate

![linear time](../Images/bigO_07.png)

#### 4. QUADRATIC & POLYNOMIAL complexity:
O(n^2) & O(n^k) - as your inputs increase your, time becomes greater at a 
certain greater rate which is related to the exponent, ^2 for quadratics, 
^k for Polynomials

#### 5. EXPONENTIAL & FACTORIAL complexity:
O(2^n) & O(n!) - rapidly increases until time and space requirements tend 
towards the infinite
